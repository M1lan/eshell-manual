** TODO "Input/Output" chapter
Document redirection.

** DONE "Process control" chapter
Remove this chapter and mention Eshell's lack of job control in the "Invocation" chapter.  Also mention the Bash-like =&= separator.

** TODO "Extension modules" chapter
- [X] Find out from johnw what this should cover.
~<johnw> aidalgol: check out em-banner.el~

** TODO "Extras and Goodies" chapter
This should be removed until the manual is finished and there are any miscellaneous topics left undocumented.

* Code
** TODO Fix =eshell/kill=
Add ability to kill non-process objects to match the documentation, and update the documentation to describe usage in more detail.

** TODO Remove predicate reference
Remove the functions =eshell-display-predicate-help= and =eshell-display-predicate-help= and their associated variables, since this is already better documented in the Zsh manual.  See [["Predicates"%20section][the corresponding TODO item for the documentation]].

** TODO Angle brackets
Figure out what angle brackets mean in Eshell.  See lines 37-39 of ~esh-var.el~.  They seem to be a half-baked implementation of Bash's =<()= behaviour.

** TODO =su= and =sudo= problems
Determine the cause of the erratic behaviour of the =su= and =sudo= commands that keeps coming up in ~#emacs~.

** TODO Bug squashing
Squash any easy bugs mentioned at the end of the manual.
