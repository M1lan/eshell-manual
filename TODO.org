Document Eshell completion.

*** DONE /Aliases/
Briefly describe Eshell aliases, and mention the aliases file.

*** DONE /History/
Appears to be complete already.  Mention the history file.

**** TODO /Built-in variables/
This appears to be complete, but check the source for any unmentioned variables.

** TODO /Arguments/
Write an overview paragraph, and fill in each subsection.

*** TODO /The Parser/
This should probably be the name of the chapter, instead of "Arguments".

*** TODO /Variables/
Document how variables are handled; most importantly, whether the scope is different from the rest of Emacs.

*** TODO /Substitution/
Document substitution.  e.g. ${command} => output of command

*** TODO /Globbing/
Document globbing.  e.g. *.el

*** TODO /Predicates/
I have briefly mentioned Eshell's support for Zsh-style globbing and reference the Zsh manual.  For now, I have also made this refer the reader to =eshell-display-predicate-help= and =eshell-display-predicate-help=, but the reference does not belong in the source code, and should be moved to the manual.

** TODO /Input/Output/
Document redirection.

** TODO /Process control/
I don't think this is handled any differently in Eshell, in which case, remove this (empty) chapter and just add a mention in the indirection to the "Invocation" chapter.

** TODO /Extension modules/
- [X] Find out from johnw what this should cover.
~<johnw> aidalgol: check out em-banner.el~

** TODO /Extras and Goodies/
This should be removed until the manual is finished and there are any miscellaneous topics left undocumented.

* Code
** TODO Fix =eshell/kill=
Add ability to kill non-process objects to match the documentation.
** TODO Bug squashing
Squash any easy bugs mentioned at the end of the manual.
