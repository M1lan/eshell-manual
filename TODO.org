Document Eshell completion.

Briefly describe Eshell aliases, and mention the aliases file.

**** TODO "Built-in variables" section
This appears to be complete, but check the source for any unmentioned variables.

** TODO "Arguments" chapter
Write an overview paragraph, and fill in each subsection.

*** TODO "The Parser" section
This should probably be the name of the chapter, instead of "Arguments".

*** TODO "Variables" section
Document how variables are handled; most importantly, whether the scope is different from the rest of Emacs.

*** TODO "Substitution" section
Document substitution.  e.g. ${command} => output of command

*** TODO "Globbing" section
Document globbing.  e.g. *.el

*** TODO "Predicates" section
I have briefly mentioned Eshell's support for Zsh-style globbing and reference the Zsh manual.  For now, I have also made this refer the reader to =eshell-display-predicate-help= and =eshell-display-predicate-help=, but the reference does not belong in the source code, and should be moved to the manual.

** TODO "Input/Output" chapter
Document redirection.

** DONE "Process control" chapter
Remove this chapter and mention Eshell's lack of job control in the "Invocation" chapter.  Also mention the Bash-like =&= separator.

** TODO "Extension modules" chapter
- [X] Find out from johnw what this should cover.
~<johnw> aidalgol: check out em-banner.el~

** TODO "Extras and Goodies" chapter
This should be removed until the manual is finished and there are any miscellaneous topics left undocumented.

* Code
** TODO Fix =eshell/kill=
Add ability to kill non-process objects to match the documentation, and update the documentation to describe usage in more detail.

** TODO Remove predicate reference
Remove the functions =eshell-display-predicate-help= and =eshell-display-predicate-help= and their associated variables, after copying the reference to the manual.  See [["Predicates"%20section][the corresponding TODO item for the documentation]].

** TODO Bug squashing
Squash any easy bugs mentioned at the end of the manual.
